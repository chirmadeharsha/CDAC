-origin of the word computer->computer(latin word)->to compute/calculate.
-data(input)->computer->information(output)(it is also know processed data.)
-information(output)(it is meaningful data)(data on whose basis the management can take some decision or you can perform some action).
-processing -> work done by the computer to convert data into information.
- Database -> collection of large amount of data
-DBMS-Database management system
		*readymade software that helps you to manage your data
		*ANSI definition-> collection of programs that allows you to Insert,update,delete,and process 
		*various DBMS availble:-
		e.g. Ms-Excel,dBase,Foxbase,Foxpro,Clipper,,Dataease,Dataflex,ADvanced REvelation,DB vista, Quattro pro, lotus 1 -2-3,etc.
ME-Excel program-> is know as a Macro(VBA programming)
*************************MYSQL*******************************
RDBMS(Relational Database Management System)
Oracle(RDBMS+OODBMS(Object Oriented DBMS)->ORDBMS(OBJECT RELATIONAL DBMS)
			********DBMS VS RDBMS***********************
DBMS(e.g.MS Exel,Foxrpo,etc.)
a. Fields
b.record
c.file
1.naming convention are different (nomenculutre is different)
5. hight n/w traffic.
6. processing is on client machine.
7.slow and	expensive.
client-server architechture is not spported.
RDBMS(E.g. MYSQL,Oracle,postgres,etc.)
a. columns,attribute,key.
b. row, tuple, entity		
c.table,Relation, Entity class.
1.naming convention are different (nomenculutre is different)
2.Relationship between 2 tables can be specified at time of table creation(e.g Foreign key constraint)
3.less programming.
4. less time required for s/w developement.
5.low n/w traffic.
6.processing is on server machine(known as client-server architecture).
7. Faster(in terms of n/w traffic) and cheaper(in terms of h/w cost,n/w cost,platform cost, infrastructure cost).
8.Most of the RDBMS support client-server architechture(expection would be MS access).
9. most of the RDBMS suppport Distributed databases.
10. mutliple level of security
a.logging in security.- (MYSQL databases username and password.)
b. commond level security.-( privilege to give certain MYSQL commands, e.g. CREATE TABLE, CREATE PROCEDURE, CREATE FUNCTION,CREATE USER, ETC)
c.object level security.-(To access the table of other users)
*server is the store the data.
*client is a access the data.
*NTFs- new technology foozle system.
***Table is a not a File **Internally every row is file****
-----------------------------which RDBMS USED-----------------
VARIOUS RDBMS Availble--------------
informix -fastest in terms of processing speed.
orcal-most popular(beacuse the programming is very easy)
3.MYSQL server-nly w-good RDBMS from Microsoft
