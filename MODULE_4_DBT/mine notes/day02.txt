Mysql- SQL(16 commands)
SQL - STRUCTURED  QUERY LANGUAGE
commonly pronounced as "Sequel".
conforms to ANSI and ISO standards
common for all RDBMS
4 sub division of sql
1.DDL-Data definition Language) (create,Drop, alter)
2.DML-Data Manipulation Language (Insert, update, Delete)
3.DCL-(Data control Language)( Grant, Revoke)
4.DQL-(Data Query Language)(select)

*Extnd Orcale:ra in Mysql a-
-Not an ANSI standards:-
-5th component of sql:
-DTL/TCL(data transaction language)/(transaction control language)
(commit , Rollback, savepoint)
-DDL (Rename,Truncate)
Extra in Oracle RDBMS only
 DML(merge, upsert)
 ***********************DATATYPES OF MYSQL***********************
 Char - allows any charater.
		- could be alpha- numeric also.
		-max 255 charcter.
		-fixed length.
		-wastage of Hard disk space.
		-searching and retrival will be fast.
		e.g. Roll_No, EMPNO,PANNO,AADHAR_CARD_NO,ETC.
		-default width 1.
Varchar - allows any character.
		- could be alpha-numeric also
		- max 65,535 character(64 kb-1)
		- varible-length.
		- conserve on Hard Disk.
		-seraching and retrieval will be slow.
		
Longtext - allows any character.
		 - could be alpha-numeric also
		 - max 4,294,967,295 character
		 -4gb -1
		 - e.g FEEDBACK, COMMENTS,REMARKS,POST,DISCRIP,RESUME,EXPERINCE,ETC.
		 -stored outside the table.
		 -stored outside the row.
		 -stored away from the table
		 -stored away from the row.
		 - Mysql maintains a Locator (HD pointer)from the longtext column to the longtext data.
		 - performance of other column in the table is not affected 
		 - not used for those column that would be used for searching
		 - used for those column that are only for storage and display purpose.

			- max upto 65,535 Bytes of binary data.
			-ICONS,GIFS WITH SOUND, THUMBNAIL,FAVICON,ETC
			- no defult width; width has to be specified
			-both of the above are stored as charcter string of 1's and 0's.
6. Blob(Binary large object)


7. LongBlob-(long binary large object)
		- max upto 4,294,967,295 bytes of binary data
		- 4 gb-1

		- stored away from the table
		- stored away from the table
		- stored away from the row.
		- Mysql maintains a loctor (HD  pointer) from the longblob cloumn to the blog 
8.INTGER types(excet value);-
			
			-by default it is signed-signed or unsigned.
		**tinyint(1 byte)
		**smallint (2 byte)
		**mediumint(3 byte)
		**Int (4 byte)
		**BigInt(8byte)
9. Floating -point types(Approximate values):-
		- *float - upto 7 decimal
		-* Double upto 15 decimal
***fixed -point types(Exact value):-*****
		 1.Decimal 
		      - stores double as  a string e.g "653.8"
			  -max number of digits is 65
			  -used when it is imp to preserve the exact precision, for example wuth monetary data.
10.Boolean 
   * logical datattype
   - true and false evaluate to 1 and 0 reserved
    -can insert true, flase, 1 or 0
    -output willdisplay 1 or 0
	e.g. MARITAL_STATUS
11. Date and Time datattype:-(7BYTE)
 **date- 1st Jan 1000 AD to 31st Dec 9999AD
		- no problem of Y2k in Mysql
		'YYYY-MM-DD' is the default date format in Myql
		e.g '2024-10-09'
		- 'YY-MM-DD' is the also supported
		- year values in the range 70-99 are converted to 1970-1999
		*year values in the range 00-69 are converted to 2000-2069
		'2024-10-09' or '24-10-09'
		'1947-08-15; '47-08-15'
		- 1970 is known as the year of the Epoch
	*date1-date2-> return the number of days between the 3 dates.
			 1st jan 1000 AD-> 1
			 2nd jan 1000 AD ->2
			 3rd  Jan 1000 Ad ->3
			 9th oct 2024 AD -.1657218(number of days since 1st jan 1000 AD)
			 * internally date is stored as a number it is
		
 ** Time 
		*'hh:mm:ss' or'HHH:MM:SS'
		- Time values may range form'-838:59:59' to'838:59:59'
		-time1-time2
 ** DateTime-date and time is stored together
			-'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss' is the default datetime format in mysql
			-'1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'
			datetime1-datetim2-> returns number of days, reminders hours, minutes, and seconds between the two.
 **year- YYYY
		- 1901 TO 2155
					*************create table************
 ******rules for tablenames,columnname,variblesname:
     * max 30 charcters
	 * A-Z,a-z,0-9 allowed
	 eg. emp,Emp,EMP,eMp etc.
*Tablename is case-insensitive for Mysql DB under windows.
*Tablename is case -sensitive for Mysql DB under Unix/Linux.
*table name has to begin with an alphabet.
*Special charcters $,#,_ allowed.
*in Mysql, to use reserved charcters such as # in tablename and colunmnname,
 enclose it in back -quotes(``)(back-quotes).e.g `EMP#`
 *134 Reserved words not allowed in tablename(Drop,create,)but we you want 
     to create this name table create then write in" ".
-EMP2024-allowed
-2024EMP- not  allowed 
IN MYSQL -you can have max 4096 columnper table provided the row size<=65,535 bytes
- no limit on the number of rows per table, provided the tablesize <= 64 terabytes.
Largest table in the world->
			orderds table of amazon.com -> 100's of Terabytes daily

1.----------------------------commond of create table -----------------------			
Create table EMP
(
Empno char(4),
Ename varchar(25),
salary flaot,
city varchar(15),
Dob date );
**** ";" is known as delimiter (also known as terminator)
**** it indicates end of commands.
**** Sql commands are case- insensitive.
**** but table name and  is case sensitive.

2.----------------------------Insert the data------------------------
Syntax of insert command :---insert into table name
values(data );
 1.*** insert into EMP
 values('1','Amit',5000,'Mumbai','1995-01-15');
 *when you are inserting, the data is case-sensitive.
 * for char, varchar, date, time, datetime use '  '.
 --* 'YYYY-MM-DD' is the default date format in mysql '1995-01-15' or'95-01-15'
 
 **********2. Recommended:- 2nd methods******
     1. Flexible
	 2. Readable
	 3. In future if you ALTER the table and add a column, then this INSERT statement will continue to work 
			insert into EMP(Empno,salary, Ename, city, dob)
			values('2',6000,'kings','delhi','1990-02-20');
3. 
  insert into EMP (Empno,salary)
  values('3',4000);
    - remaining all colums store the null values.
	 -null values only one bytes stroage. but in last 2 cloumns  are present null value then no space is store.
	 -Special treatement given to null value in all RDBMS.
	  -null value is independent of datatype
	  -null value occupies only 1 bytes of storage
	  -those columns that are likely to have a large number of nulls, 
	     it's recommended that preferably they should be specified 
	     at the end of the tabble structure, to conserve on HD space.
4. insert into EMP
values('3''attt');////error it is not allowed
5. insert into EMP
values('4','amp',null,Null,null);//it is ok it is allowed.
6.insert into EMP
values ('6', Null, 5000, null,null);//ok 


****we can write INSERT multiple row in a table using one insert eStatementes
insert into EMP values
('1','as',345,'mum','1995-09-25'),
('2','ar',34,'san','1994-09-15'),
('3','as',345,'mum','1995-09-1'),
('4','ae3',3459,'mumr','1994-02-12'),
('5','qw',null,null,null,null);


OR


*********************************select the data form table **********************
Syntax of SELECT
    select * from tablename;
	*internally how to work select commandis wroking
	1.read .
	2. compile.
	3. plan.
	4.Execute.
-* is known as metacharcter(all coumns)
----------------------to restrict the colums:(use select)-----------------
1.select empno,ename *from emp;
- output is only empno,ename columns is display.
2. select deptno,job,ename,sal,hiredate from emp;
-output is deptno,job ,ename ,sal,hiredate this order colum is display.
 *the position of column in SELECT statement will determine the position of column in the output.
 * this you will write as per Client requirements.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *****to restrict the rows   (WHERE clause is used)
 syntax 
    select *from emp where colum nu = value
	eg. 
1.select *from emp
	where dept no=10;
	-output is d=show only dept no 10 rows are dispalay
*where clause is used for searching.
*searching takes place in DB server HD
* where clause is used to restrict the rows.
*where clause is used to retrive the rows from DB server  HD to server RAM.
2. select* from emp
where sal>2000;
-output is shows only salary is greater than 2000 this employee data is display.
*************************Relational operators in MYSQL:-********************
1.>
2. >=
3.<
4.<=
5.!= or <>
6.=
Relational operators is exectued is only this manner.
3. select *from emp
 where sal >2000 and sal<3000;
 -output is shows between the 2000 and 3000 salary employee data is display.
 ***************************logical operators in mysql****************************
 NOT=no one is satsified.
 AND-both are true /satsified.
 OR = any one is satsified.
 ***logical operators are exectue is above mannaers.
4. select *form emp
where deptno =10 or sal>2000 and sal<3000;
output-
5. select *from emp
where (deptno =10 or sal> 2000)and sal<3000;

6. select * from emp
where job = 'MANAGER';
output- shows the all job which is manager all data of employee is display.
*for char, varchar,date,time, and datetime use ' '
*when we are write 'manager' this way also this is show output is same is above.
***In Mysql-
 * when you are searching , quries are case-sensitive
 * more user-friendly
*** In other RDBMS:-
  * when you are searching, quries are case-sensitive
  * more secure.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.select *from emp 
where job='MANAGER' and job='CLERK';
output- nothing is display.
8.select *from emp 
where job='MANAGER' or job='CLERK';
output- all manager and clerk both job display.
8.  select ename, salary,salary*12 from emp;( in given table data salary *12 column is not present  but only this query salary *12 is created only this query and display after this query execution this column is distroyed. )
salary*12 - computed column, calculted column, virtual column, fake column, pseudo column
********Arithmatic operators*************
***jitne colum titke array*****
1.()
2. /
3. *
4.+ 
5.-

******************************alias(another name)*****************
ALIAS THE any column name is used 'as'
9.select ename, salary, salary*12 as "ANNUAL" from emp;
in above query salalry*12 column is created only display time this column is now display with annual column name only for exectuing time after exectution this coilm=unm is erase.
* as= ANSI SQL.
*as= optional of mysql.
10.select ename, salary, salary*12 as annual from emp;
-ouput is disply annunal comlumn name is automaticalyy converted into  ANNUAL name(means in uppercase)
11. select ename, salary, salary*12 as "Annual Salary in $" from emp;
12.select ename, salary, salary*12 "Annual " from emp;
-output is same as above but " " and 'as' is optional
*****in Alias not used where clause.
